= Testing ShadowFacter

Testing Targets:

* Official Ubuntu ec2 instances: ami-814aaee8 (32) and ami-a84aaec1 (64)
* VMWare ubuntu 8.10 server install
* Slicehost Ubuntu
* RM Ubuntu (in development)

== Installation

For now, *imagine* that you're doing a `apt-get install shadow_facter`, and instead, do the following:

  # sudo apt-get install rubygems puppet git-core
  # sudo scp oper@gw01.gnax.railsmachine.net:shadow_facter*.gem .
  # sudo gem install shadow_facter-0.0.1.gem --no-rdoc --no-ri

== Running ShadowFacter

This is a gem binary. Ubuntu is stupid about gems and sudo (SECURE_PATH issues), so you'll have to specify the whole (weird) path:

  # sudo /var/lib/gems/1.8/bin/shadow_facter

Follow the provided instructions. git@git.railsmachine.com:test_rails_app is a good test rails app if you need one.

When the setup prompts you to add your SSH key to your git host, please ping me, I'll add it.
