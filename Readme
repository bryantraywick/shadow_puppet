== Installation

For now, *imagine* that you're doing a `apt-get install moonshine`, and instead, do the following as root:

  # apt-get install libopenssl-ruby git-core
  # scp oper@gw01.gnax.railsmachine.net:moonshine-0.0.1.gem
  # gem install moonshine-0.0.1.gem

== Running Moonshine

You'll want to run this as root. Ubuntu is stupid about gems, so you'll have to specify the whole (weird) path:

  # /var/lib/gems/1.8/bin/moonshine

Follow the provided instructions. git@git.railsmachine.com:test_rails_app is a good test rails app if you need one
