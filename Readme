= Testing Moonshine

== Installation

For now, *imagine* that you're doing a `apt-get install moonshine`, and instead, do the following:

  # sudo apt-get install rubygems libopenssl-ruby git-core
  # sudo scp oper@gw01.gnax.railsmachine.net:moonshine-0.0.1.gem .
  # sudo gem install moonshine-0.0.1.gem  --no-rdoc --no-ri

== Running Moonshine

This is a gem binary. Ubuntu is stupid about gems and sudo (SECURE_PATH issues), so you'll have to specify the whole (weird) path:

  # sudo /var/lib/gems/1.8/bin/moonshine

Follow the provided instructions. git@git.railsmachine.com:test_rails_app is a good test rails app if you need one.

When the setup prompts you to add your SSH key to your git host, please ping me, I'll add it.
