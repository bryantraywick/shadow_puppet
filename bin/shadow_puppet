    DESCRIPTION
      A Ruby DSL for puppet

    EXAMPLES
      Sample manifest:

        #foo.rb
        class Foo < ShadowPuppet::Manifest
          recipe :foo

          def foo
            exec :foo, :command => '/bin/echo "foo" > /tmp/foo.txt'
            file '/tmp/example.txt', :ensure => :present, :content => Facter.to_hash.inspect
          end
        end

      Executing this manifest:

        $ shadow_puppet foo.rb
        notice: /shadow_puppet:19861340/Exec[foo]/returns: executed successfully
        $

      The shadow_puppet binary parses the given ruby code, which is
      expected to contain a class named Foo that inherits from
      ShadowPuppet::Manifest. An instance of this class is created, and the
